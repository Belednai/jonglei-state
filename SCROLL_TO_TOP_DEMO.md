# Scroll-to-Top Implementation Demo

## Before Implementation
- Navigation buttons would land at various scroll positions
- Users might land mid-page or at bottom of content
- Inconsistent user experience across different screen sizes
- No focus management for accessibility

## After Implementation
- All navigation buttons consistently land at scrollTop = 0
- Smooth, predictable user experience
- Proper accessibility focus management
- Preserved anchor link behavior
